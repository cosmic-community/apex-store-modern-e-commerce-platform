// Get all products with collections
const { objects: products } = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'products' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])

  .depth(1)
```

## üîó Cosmic CMS Integration

This application uses Cosmic as a headless CMS with the following content structure:

### Products Object Type
- **Product Name** (text) - The product title
- **Description** (html-textarea) - Rich text product description
- **Price** (number) - Product price
- **Product Images** (files) - Multiple product images
- **In Stock** (switch) - Stock availability status
- **Collections** (objects) - Related collections

### Collections Object Type
- **Collection Name** (text) - Collection title
- **Description** (textarea) - Collection description
- **Featured Image** (file) - Collection banner image

### Reviews Object Type
- **Customer Name** (text) - Reviewer name
- **Rating** (select-dropdown) - 1-5 star rating
- **Review Text** (textarea) - Review content
- **Product** (object) - Related product
- **Verified Purchase** (switch) - Purchase verification status

The application leverages Cosmic's powerful relationship system to connect products with collections and reviews, using the `depth` parameter to efficiently fetch related data in a single query.
